# Button 

This component receives the styles of a button, but can be rendered as another tag (if necessary).

### Default

It renders with the `button` tag

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id="components-button--default" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="^" />

### Custom Component

To use the `Slot` function, the `asChild` prop must be passed as `true` and the tag (to be rendered in place of the `button` tag) must be passed along with its content (in the `children` prop).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--custom-component" />
</Canvas>
