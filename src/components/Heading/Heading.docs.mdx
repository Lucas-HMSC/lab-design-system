# Heading 

This component receives the styles of a title.

### Default

The title text renders with the `h2` tag and with the size of `24px`.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id="components-heading--default" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="^" />

### Small

The title text renders with the size of `20px`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-heading--small" />
</Canvas>

### Large

The title text renders with the size of `32px`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-heading--large" />
</Canvas>

### Custom Component

To use the `Slot` function, the `asChild` prop must be passed as `true` and the tag (to be rendered in place of the `h2` tag) must be passed along with its content (in the `children` prop).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-heading--custom-component" />
</Canvas>
