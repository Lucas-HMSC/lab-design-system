# Text 

This component receives the text styles.

### Default

The text is rendered with the `span` tag and with the size of `16px`.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id="components-text--default" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="^" />

### Small

The text renders with the size of `14px`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text--small" />
</Canvas>

### Large

The text renders with the size of `18px`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text--large" />
</Canvas>

### Custom Component

To use the `Slot` function, the `asChild` prop must be passed as `true` and the tag (to be rendered in place of the `span` tag) must be passed along with its content (in the `children` prop).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text--custom-component" />
</Canvas>
